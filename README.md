# Project Name: Nestalk

## Primary Goals
- Track candidate inquiries (especially from ads) and monitor outreach follow-up actions.
- Manage client inquiries for staffing and training — with clear status updates and reminders.
- Record interview schedules, attendance, and outcomes in one central place.
