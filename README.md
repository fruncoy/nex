# Project Name: Nestalk

## Description
Nestalk is a lightweight internal web application designed for the Nestara team to efficiently track candidate outreach, client inquiries, and training interest, replacing cumbersome Excel sheets and WhatsApp threads

## Primary Goals
- Track candidate inquiries (especially from ads) and monitor outreach follow-up actions.
- Manage client inquiries for staffing and training — with clear status updates and reminders.
- Record interview schedules, attendance, and outcomes in one central place.
- Enable team accountability with timestamped updates and activity visibility.
- Keep it simple — no document uploads, no profile storage duplication (Zoho handles that).
